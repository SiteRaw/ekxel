# SiteRaw Ekxel

A simple web based spreadsheet editor from SiteRaw https://www.siteraw.com

## Features

Turn any CSV file into a spreadsheet, and back again. Many web based functionalities (add/move/remove row/column).

You can click any column header to rank the data in ascending or descending order.

### Languages:

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS

### WIP

This is a WIP. It's more of a fun Javascript project than a viable web tool. Don't use it for important stuff, use the real Excel instead.
